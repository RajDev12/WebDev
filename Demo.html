    <h4>HTML Tags Vs Elements</h4> 
    <!-- Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag,
     its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. 
     On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element,
      as you can see in the above illustration. -->
    <p class="fclass">This is a para of fclass</p>
    <!--  p is the t=html tag, class is attribute andfclass is the value of the attribute -->
    <!-- Technocally an element in html conatins start tag,attribute and its values,end tag .
    On the other hand a tag is is used to mark the start and end of and element  -->

    <!-- html is not case sensative <p> and <P> is the same  -->

    <!-- ***Empty HTML Elements == <br>,<hr>, <img>,<input> -->
    <!-- HTML tags should be nested in correct order. They must be closed in the inverse order of how they are defined,
         that means the last tag opened must be closed first. -->
    <!-- HTML Elements Types -->
    <!-- Elements can be placed in two distinct groups: block level and inline level elements. 
            The former make up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block
            The most commonly used block-level elements are <div>, <p>, <h1> through <h6>, <form>, <ol>, <ul>, <li>, and so on.
        Whereas, the commonly used inline-level elements are <img>, <a>, <span>, <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <code>, <input>, <button>, etc. -->
    <!-- There are several attributes in HTML5 that do not consist of name/value pairs but consist of just a name. 
        Such attributes are called Boolean attributes. Examples of some commonly used Boolean attributes are checked, disabled, readonly, required, etc. -->
    <input type="email" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" disabled>
    <input type="checkbox" checked>
    <input type="text" value="Read only text" readonly>
    <!-- Attribute values are generally case-insensitive, except certain attribute values, like the id and class attributes -->

    <p>
        <!-- The value of the title attribute (i.e. title text) is displayed as a tooltip by the web browsers when the user place mouse cursor over the element. -->

    <!-- Each time you place a heading tag on a web page, 
    the web browser built-in style sheets automatically create some empty space (called margin) before and after each heading. 
    You can use the CSS margin property to override the browser's default style sheet -->

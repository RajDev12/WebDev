<h1>Creating Links in HTML</h1>
<h3>A link has two ends, called anchors.
    The link starts at the source anchor and points to the destination anchor, which may be any web resource, 
    for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on. -->
</h3>
 <ol>
    <a href="Demo.html" target="_blank">Link text</a>
    <li> An unvisited link is underlined and blue. </li>
    <li> A visited link is underlined and purple. </li>
    <li>  An active link is underlined and red. </li>
 </ol>
 <pre id="SectionA"> Setting the Targets for Links
 The target attribute tells the browser where to open the linked document.
  There are four defined targets, and each target name starts with an underscore(_) character:
 
 _blank — Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
 _parent — Opens the linked document in the parent window.
 _self — Opens the linked document in the same window or tab as the source document. This is the default, hence it is not necessary to explicitly specify this value.
 _top — Opens the linked document in the full browser window. 

 <b>A target attribute with the value of “_parent” opens the linked document in the parent frame.
     A target attribute with the value of “_top” opens the linked document in the full body of the window.
    
     <i><u>Creating Bookmark Anchors</i></u>
     Creating bookmarks is a two-step process: first add the id attribute on the element where you want to jump, 
     then use that id attribute value preceded by the hash sign (#) as the value of the href attribute of the <a> tag.
        <a href="#SectionA">Jump to Section A</a>

Tip: You can even jump to a section of another web page by specifying the URL of that page along with the anchor (i.e. #elementId) in the href attribute,
         for example, <a href="mypage.html#topicA">Go to TopicA</a>.

         <i><u>Creating Downloadable Link</i></u>
         <a href="images\A24_12014332.png">Download Image</a>
         <a href="images\test.zip">Download File</a> 

         Note: 1.Only zip file downloaded automatically.
               2. When you click a link that points to a PDF or image file, the file is not downloaded to your hard drive directly. 
                 It will only open the file in your web browser. Further you can save or download it to your hard drive on a permanent basis.
